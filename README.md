## Introduction

Chess is a strategic board game that has been played for centuries. While online chess 
platforms have gained popularity, some enthusiasts still enjoy playing the game OTB (over the board). This website serves as resource for those who like to play their game offline and don´t want to spend money on a chess clock.

## Features

- Setting individual player times using text fields
- Starting/Stopping/Resetting the timer with buttons
- Toggling the timer by pressing the space bar
- **NO INCREMENT!** This chess clock is made to flag your opponents ;)

## Installation

As this website is an online-only application, there is no installation process involved. Simply visit the website **[howtoplaychessofflinefast.com](https://howtoplaychessofflinefast.com)** using your web browser to access all the content.

## Usage

The website is designed to be minimalistic and maximally user-friendly. Due to the fact that _v1.0_ does not yet include information on the correct use of the clock, here are the main features you´ll find on the website.

1. **Setting Time:** Using the text fields, the times can be set in the format _mm < 100 ss < 60_ individually for each player.
2. **Start the Timer:** As soon as a valid time has been set for both players, the timer can be started by pressing the _start_ -button.
3. **Toggle the Timer:** After a player has played his turn, he can toggle the timer by pressing the _space bar_.
4. **Stop the Timer:** While the timer is running, the _play_ -button changes to the _pause_ -button, which pauses the timer when pressed.
5. **Reset the Timer:** Pressing the _reset_ -button resets the entire timer to _0_ and implies the end of the game or the start of a new game.
